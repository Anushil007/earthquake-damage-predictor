We need to merge all these cols to a single col 


Grade 1 : Hairline to thin cracks in plaster on few walls, falling of plaster bits in limited parts, fall of loose stone from upper part of the building in a few cases, only architectural repairs needed.

Grade 2 : Cracks in many walls, falling of plaster in last bits over large area, damage to non structural parts like chimney, projecting cornices. The load carrying capacity of the building is not reduced appreciably.

Grade 3 : Large and extensive cracks in most walls, collapse of small portion of non load-bearing walls, roof tile detachment, tilting or failing of chimneys, failure of individual non-structural elements such as partition/gable walls, delamination of stone/adobe walls, load carrying capacity of structure is partially reduced and significant structural repair is required.

Grade 4 : Large gaps occur in walls, walls collapse, partial structural failure of floor/roof, building takes a dangerous state.

Grade 5 : Total or near collapse of the building
