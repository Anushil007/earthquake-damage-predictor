# AI BASED EARHTHQUAKE DAMAGE PREDICTION SYSTEM
## Introduction
The project "Earthquake Damage Prediction System" is a Machine learning project developed for Fusemachines AI fellowship program. This system is developed with aim to predict damage of buildings due to earthquake. Currently, our models have been trained and tested using only Nepali earthquake dataset taken from Kaggle.com <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/code/ar89dsl/predicting-building-damage-from-earthquakes/data?select=csv_building_structure.csv"> Dataset </a>. Our system can currently predict the earthquake damage grades on buildings with test f1-score of 90% and train f1-score 95%. Here, a user will have to enter some details of the building like number of floors, height of building, age etc and then get the damage grade predicted for that building. <br>
